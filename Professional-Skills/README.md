# Introduction to the Professional Skills Curriculum

Many companies have budgets for employees to do job development training or professional development (PD) in an ongoing way. Many also have periodic sessions where employees have the chance to get better at giving and receiving feedback, or managing their time, or other soft skills. Velisa Professional Skills Curriculum is designed to feel like real PD that would happen in a real job. The sessions help you prepare materials you will need to apply for jobs and gain skills that will make you successful in the workplace. Through readings, videos, projects and ongoing practice, you will:

Build strong communication skills
Create a portfolio to use when applying for jobs
Learn problem-solving, conflict management, and other key workplace skills
Gain confidence in yourself as a learner and colleague
Learn about cultural differences in the workplace and the expectations of global tech companies
Get better at networking
Have the chance to work on writing
And much, much more

Professional Skills Curriculum Topics
The lessons included in the Professional Skills Curriculum are designed with Velisa students in mind. Many come straight from problems that have arisen for students, questions they have had, and specific needs they have at the job application stage. To ensure the solo curriculum meets the needs of students, new content is added when needed.

A sampling of current lessons in the Professional Skills Curriculum includes:

Working Through Conflict with Coding Partners, TSEs and Future Colleagues
How to Give Positive and Constructive Feedback
How to Look Professional Online
Freelancing Simulations

We suggest you start at the beginning and work through the lessons in order. However, if you find yourself needing support on a particular skill (such as working through conflict) you can jump to this lesson first. The Freelancing Simulations must be completed in order.

The Professional Skills Curriculum and Career Prep
Although the Professional Skills Curriculum helps you get ready for your future job, it is important to understand that it is not Career Prep. The Career Prep Curriculum is a separate set of activities specifically designed to support you during the time you are preparing to apply for jobs, interviewing, and negotiating offers. You will move on to that curriculum after you have completed the Technical Curriculum, this Professional Skills Curriculum, and your coding challenges.

Many skills you will work on in the Professional Skills Curriculum will help prepare you for Interview Prep and boost your confidence and soft skills. You'll even begin some of the initial steps for work you will later go over with your career coach. But , mock interviewing, negotiating offers and other application-related tasks are covered in Interview Prep.

# What are Soft Skills?

### What are soft skills? Why do they matter? How can you improve yours?

In general, soft skills are attitudes and habits that shape how you work, alone and on teams. Soft skills help you develop strong relationships with coworkers and contribute to a positive work culture. Examples of soft skills valued by employers:

Teamwork
Integrity
Good communication skills
Reliability
Organization

## Improving Soft Skills Takes Practice

As you work through the Professional Skills Curriculum lessons, remember that soft skills get better with awareness and practice. No matter what stage of our career, we all have areas we can improve on. Perhaps you are a good communicator, but struggle with time management. Maybe you are the most punctual person ever, but have a hard time speaking your opinions. With each lesson in the Professional Skills Curriculum, we will help you learn about your strengths and areas of weakness and give you lots of chances to practice and improve.

# What are your strengths and weaknesses?

An important step to begin improving soft skills is to be comfortable looking at our own strengths and weaknesses. Self awareness and understanding are essential for learning to work better with others. As an exercise in understanding yourself better, please complete The 16 Personalities Test:

# How to Use Google Calendar to Get (And Stay) Organized and Effective!

The first and most important step of managing your Google Calendar is this: just use it. Constantly adding meetings and time blocks to your calendar can feel like a waste of time--after all, most of us tend to rely on our own memories. But we’re all humans, and humans forget things sometimes. We miss deadlines, we forget about important tasks, we mix up time zones and accidentally show up at meetings an hour early (or worse: an hour late).

Managing a Google Calendar can take 10 minutes out of your day, yes--time that you may want to spend coding or relaxing or just grabbing a cup of coffee. It can be boring and repetitive but like many boring, repetitive tasks, it is absolutely necessary. Those 10 minutes of organization can be the difference between you missing an interview or not, or between meeting a work deadline and forgetting it. Get in the habit right now of using your Google Calendar, and continue using it.

Using it is necessary. But there are tips and tricks you can take advantage of that will make using your Google Calendar organization simpler and even more useful. We’ll start with basic organizational strategies, and then discuss some of the cool features Google Calendar offers--features that will hopefully allow you to take control of your schedules, rather than having your schedules control you!

# Setting Goals

### Why do we set goals?

Goals help us get work done more efficiently and productively. When you start your day you will be much more effective, productive, and motivated when you have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish.

A second purpose of goals is to turn big tasks into smaller, more attainable goals.

The goal of "Finishing Microverse" can seem much more overwhelming compared to "finishing the first HTML part of the curriculum."

Bigger, long term goals, can seem harder and more overwhelming that smaller short term goals. That is why we ask you to make your goals as small as possible.

# LinkedIn Profile

[video to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ2xiTvVhpM)

## Crafting a Stellar LinkedIn Profile: An Introduction

LinkedIn is one of the most widely-used professional networking services online, and having a great profile can result in both increased recruiter outreach and a 71% higher chance of getting invited to job interviews. In order to create a profile that will grab a recruiter's attention, though, you'll need to fill every section as thoroughly as possible.

[Reading](https://www.resumego.net/research/linkedin-interview-chances/)

# The header and tagline

The header and tagline comprises everything in that first block of your LinkedIn profile, from your photo to your contact info. It also encompasses almost all of the new content you'll be writing; nearly everything else will be copy-pasted directly from your resume.

### Update your URL

Firstly, make sure that you’ve updated the default LinkedIn URL to a professional, personalized one (preferably using some combination of your first, middle, and/or last names). You can edit this easily by navigating to your profile page and clicking “Edit public profile & URL.”

## Add a cover photo

Adding a cover photo to your LinkedIn is a quick, simple way to personalize your profile, and while Microverse does not require you to update your cover photo, we do strongly recommend it. You can use anything from a stock photo of code to a high-quality image of your hometown to a custom-made banner--as long as the photo is professional and high-quality (not grainy or blurred), feel free to inject a bit of your personality. If you're not sure what type of cover photo to use, please read Austin Belcak's great article on how to choose (or create) a fantastic cover photo for some excellent advice.

# Add your headline

Note: to edit your headline, click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of your Intro block. The gif above shows you how to access it.

As a default, LinkedIn provides you with an automatic headline: [your current job title] at [your current place of work]. Unfortunately, however, that default headline isn't keyword optimized, and (because it's the default), most software developer profiles on LinkedIn will have nearly identical headlines. The good news is that even small changes to your headline will help you with keyword optimization and standing out.

A strong headline should contain at least two (and preferably all three) of the following elements:

Your job title (required)
Keywords (required)
A metric, goal, or accomplishment (strongly preferred)

Your job title will be something like "Software Engineer" or "Web Developer." Your keywords can include your specific tech stack, major tools you've worked with, or the type of development you focus on. And metrics, like always, are something cool you've accomplished.

Here are a few examples you can use as models while creating your own headline:

Software Engineer | Development, Design, & Architecture | Building Click-and-Drag Kanban Tools with Redux

Full-Stack Web Developer. JavaScript, Rails, React, Redux. Improving open-source projects, one commit at a time

Software Developer & Web Designer. I help startups take their products from concept to launch. Need help? Contact me below.

Software Engineer. In love with pair-programming, JavaScript, and remote work.

Two things to keep in mind:

Don't use up space on mentioning that you're currently looking for a job. You can indicate that elsewhere on your profile (which we'll discuss momentarily), and the space could be better used for keywords or metrics.
If you include your stack, don't include HTML or CSS; if you're a developer, it's expected that you'll know HTML and CSS. Use the space for more worthwhile keywords.

# Add your education to the Intro block

# Add your contact information

At the very least, your contact information must include the following:

Your email address
A link to your GitHub
A link to your portfolio

You may add other links as well (for example links to your Medium, professional Twitter, etc.), but these three links are essential.

# "About Me"

According to most students, the "About Me" is the hardest (and most intimidating) section of the LinkedIn profile. The good news, however, is that you can use a simple formula to create a short but engaging pitch.

[Your elevator pitch] + [Your stack] + [A call to action]

An elevator pitch is a short, persuasive introduction to who you are and your major accomplishments. Your stack (which you've already written as part of your resume) gives recruiters an idea of the technologies you've worked with. And the call to action invites recruiters, hiring managers, and others to contact you.

# Featured

Why is the Featured section important?

The Featured section is one of the first blocks that a hiring manager will see when they click into your profile: it's large, image-heavy, and located near the top of your LinkedIn. In other words, it's a space where you can immediately grab a recruiter's attention, and you should be using it to its fullest effect. Let's talk about what to add.

What can you add in the Featured section?

At a minimum, the Featured Section should include links three of your most complex, attractive projects. However, there are also other things you can add. Here's a list of ideas:

At least 3 of your most complex, attractive projects (add as links to the live demos)
Your resume (add as media)
A project walkthrough recorded on Loom or Youtube (add as a link)
A link to your portfolio (add as a link)
Web development articles you've posted online (add as a link)
Development-related presentations you've given (add as media or as a link)

Try to limit yourself to 5-6 items, total.

How to correctly add projects to the Featured section

To add a project to the Featured section, click the plus icon on the upper right corner. You'll be given the option to either add media, a link, posts, or articles. For the most part, you should select either media or link--the bullet points above explain when to use which option.

Paste the link or upload a file you'd like to add to the Featured section. Once you do so, you'll be given a preview screen containing a default image, a title, and a description. While you cannot edit the default image within LinkedIn, you can edit the title and description. Feel free to copy/paste your GitHub project descriptions into the description field - you don't have to write entirely new descriptions.

Once done, save your project. You can view the gif below for help.

Make sure your Featured projects have thumbnails

Finally, arrange your best projects first
